# Context 

Our platform offers a series of functionalities that will positively impact the inner workings of our college, helping both teachers and students by providing a single, simple to use solution through which courses can be accessed and assignments distributed and centralized.

# Accessing to the Platform

In order to keep things simple, access to the platform does not require registration, access being (should be) granted through your college login information.

# Functionalities
The core idea around which everything else works is the **Course**. Teachers can create courses and students can access them.

## Teacher's 
Each teacher can add the courses he teaches and for each one of those courses he can create (weekly) **modules**.

Each **module** can contain, depending on the teachers choice:
* a studying part 
* an assignment (homework)
* other materials beyond the course for interested students
